# CongressSearch
This is a simple search application for searching for members of congress as well as various congressional bills. It was createad
bc I found API's used to search congress related records to be inefficient and difficult to use for most people so I created a 
simple UI for searching them as well as a backend layer to host data pulled from a third party API. This application utilizes
ProPublica's API for data fetching and storing. Note: This is mainly to be used as a showcase of my skills to prospective
employers and is merely a demo. Not everything is complete bc I want to keep it small enough for quick and easy reading
but rich enough bc a simple to-do app isn't going to win anyone over :)
