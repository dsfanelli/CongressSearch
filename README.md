# CongressSearch
This is a simple search application for searching for members of congress as well as various congressional bills. It was createad bc I found API's used to search congress related records to be inefficient and difficult to use and most publically available search engines seem a bit overwhelming in their UI for most people. In response to these issues, I created a simple UI for searching congressional records as well as a backend layer to host data pulled from a third party API. This application utilizes ProPublica's API for data fetching and storing. Note: This is mainly to be used as a showcase of my skills to prospective employers and is merely a demo. Not everything is complete bc I want to keep it small enough for quick and easy reading but rich enough bc a simple to-do app isn't going to win anyone over :)

WARNING: I'm not "big on politics" so you may (hopefully not) come across some mistakes related to my knowledge holes,
but keep in mind THIS IS A DEMO :)
